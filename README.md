#TraceJSON


TraceJSON allows you to get the ipinfo of the nodes in your traceroute in JSON format. Made with Pedro.

First run a traceroute and save to a text file:
	
	traceroute somehost.com > somehost_traceroute.txt

Next clone the repo:

	git clone https://github.com/aankit/tracejson.git

Unzip the archive called traceJSON.

Run the JSONTrace, choose your file, and get ready to do something with JSON!
